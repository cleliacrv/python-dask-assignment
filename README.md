# Advanced Python course: Dask Assignment

Author: Clelia Cervetto

This is the Advanced Python individual Project for the elective in the Master of Business Analytics and Big Data.

## Instructions: Rewrite the Bike Sharing analysis using Dask

- Submission format: A .zip produced by `$ git archive master --format=zip -o LastName_FirstName_Dask.zip` and a link to the GitHub repository, which must be public right after the deadline.

The objective is to rewrite the Bike Sharing analysis done in the Python for Statistical Programming subject using Dask data structures and ecosystem instead of plain pandas.

The reasons for choosing this are:

- The dataset is comparatively small, and the extra computing time is given by feature engineeering and model selection, which lowers the risk
- Everybody has performed this analysis and is relatively familiar with it, which makes it easier than carrying a data science project from scratch, given the time constraints
- Rewriting an existing analysis to make it more performant is more aligned with the objectives of the subject and reflects more real world escenarios
- The "business objectives" are more clear than in the group assignment

The maximum score of the assignment is 4 points and the grading will be as follows:

- **Creation of a git repository with a proper README, incremental commits, and some sort of automatic or programmatic download of the data before the analysis (1 point)**. Notice that the data should not be checked out in the repository. Including data files in git repositories is considered a bad practice.
- **Use of dask.dataframe and distributed.Client for all the data manipulation (2 points)**. Remember that calling .compute() in a Dask DataFrame turns it into a pandas dataframe, which resides in RAM and loses the distributed advantages. The more Dask structures are used, the higher the grade.
- **Use of Dask-ML for distributed training and model selection https://ml.dask.org/ (1 point)**. See below for inspiration.

As you can see, the assignment is more open ended. Use this as a opportunity to explore, and don't be afraid of recording failed experiments in the notebook, if they are properly explained and described.
